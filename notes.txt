 For node project setup run "npm init";

 node will ask questions regarding the project fill and see your project setup is completed;

 now go to package.json file and add start script in script object of package.json "start":"node index.js",
 by using this you can start your project by using "npm run start" instade of using "node index.js";

install express by using "npm i express";

do basic setup for express app and make a const for port where app will be listen req here it is 5000;

for app's confidenctial variables use "dotenv" package and initiate in index.js file by using "require(dotenv).config()";

for example purposes we have created .env file and defined "PORT = 5000";

for access of that variable used "process.enc.PORT" 

    example :--> app.listen(process.env.PORT, () => {
                 console.log(`Example app listening on port ${process.env.PORT}!`);
                });
